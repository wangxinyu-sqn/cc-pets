This project follows Semantic Versioning. `package.json` is the single source of
truth for the version.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-23

First open-source release.

### Pet and interaction

- Native macOS AppKit desktop pet with no Electron runtime and no dependency on the Codex or Claude desktop apps.
- Idle breathing, random movements, drag lag and landing bounce, plus hover and click feedback for the head, pocket, feet, and both body sides.
- The right-click menu can switch pets, refresh usage, toggle quota history and system notifications, check for updates, or exit.
- Supports built-in assets and external assets under `~/.cc-pets/pets/`, with `spriteVersionNumber` v1 and v2 grids.

### Quota and usage

- Reads five-hour quota, weekly quota, and reset times from local `~/.codex/sessions` data and Claude Code's official status line input.
- Hovering over the pocket opens a panel with separate Codex and Claude cards for remaining percentage, local tokens, and seven-day trends.
- Optionally records seven days of local quota history; disabled by default and stored only on the local machine.
- Supports Subscription quota and API usage display modes.

### Agent status

- Codex Hooks and Claude Code Hooks drive animations for thinking, tool calls, approvals, subagents, completion, and failure.
- Displays a redacted glass status card beside the pet, which can be collapsed and shows the active CLI session count.
- macOS notifications can be enabled separately for completion, failure, and approval requests.
- Third-party CLI agents can integrate through the unified Provider event protocol; see [`PROVIDER_PROTOCOL.md`](./PROVIDER_PROTOCOL.md).

### Speech

- All pet speech comes from `~/.cc-pets/speech.txt`, can be edited in the built-in editor, and supports live data placeholders.
- Per-pet speech can be stored at `~/.cc-pets/speech/<pet-name>.txt` and replaces global speech by section.
- Includes four speech-frequency levels and stays silent while an agent is working.

### Installation and integration

- `npm install -g cc-pets` builds the native app, installs both hook integrations and shell integration, and installs `~/Applications/CC Pets.app`.
- Symlinks under `~/.cc-pets/shims` intercept `codex` and `claude`, including casing variants, to start the pet.
- `cc-pets install`, `uninstall`, and `uninstall-app` provide repeatable initialization and cleanup flows.

### Privacy

- Uploads no conversations, quotas, credentials, or usage statistics and contains no telemetry.
- Status cards and notifications show only the provider, state category, and redacted tool category.
